-> [BUG] CRSF Token invalidates after inserting wrong data in the backend login

-> Finish Backend configuration
	--> add entity select (html, css and js)

-> create a backend configuration to select the 404 controller and action and load this automatically instead of the currently
hardcoded fallback

-> [FEATURE] Add a translation system
	-> loaded some translations from the template. For example: the name, description, help-text or placeholder of a configuration

-> SEO Analizer: save every page load in two tables: today and total. Count and save the today entries every night and save it
   for this day in total

-> implement a way to separate resources by the namespace and the "use" statement inside the plugins.xml

-> Find a better way to get the current http_host than by calling $_SERVER['http_host'] (not trust worthy)
